# py_age_verification
I wrote this python script because I work at gas station and hated asking people who were clearly of age for their I.d. when buying alcohol or cigarettes. The company I work for doesn't I.d. if you appear over 35 and are known to the cashier (i.e. a regular, and working 3rd most are) but they also track duplicate birthday entries and if your percentage of dublicates is high enough you get a write up or even fired. So this script creates a random birthday and adds it to a file and everytime is randomizes a new birthday it checks that file to see if that day was already used, if it was it then randomizes another date and will do so until it doesn't have one on the list and then give you the number. This script works on cell phones with both qpython and termux w/ python2 installed, also can be easily modified for python3
